# Blogify


## Introduction

This is a pet project I developed while learning Django Rest Framework. It replicates the functionalities of a real-world blog platform, including:

- CRUD operations for posts and authors
- Liking and commenting on posts
- Personal profile pages for each user
- Categorizing posts into various categories
- Searching for posts and authors
- Leaderboards for both posts and authors

Additionally, I have integrated new features such as:

- A chat lobby for user interactions
- Notifications for users to receive updates on interactions with their posts
- Security features including password recovery via email and account activation through email

Please note that this project is a basic implementation and contains various shortcomings and potential bugs, as it is primarily a learning exercise for Django Rest Framework. For a more polished and comprehensive source code example, you can refer to my school attendance support website project here: [PBL04_DUT_student-checkin-system](https://github.com/tranductri2003/PBL04_DUT_student-checkin-system).
