# Blogify


## Introduction

This is a pet project I developed while learning Django Rest Framework. It replicates the functionalities of a real-world blog platform, including:

- CRUD operations for posts and authors
- Liking and commenting on posts
- Personal profile pages for each user
- Categorizing posts into various categories
- Searching for posts and authors
- Leaderboards for both posts and authors

Additionally, I have integrated new features such as:

- A chat lobby for user interactions
- Notifications for users to receive updates on interactions with their posts
- Security features including password recovery via email and account activation through email

Please note that this project is a basic implementation and contains various shortcomings and potential bugs, as it is primarily a learning exercise for Django Rest Framework. For a more polished and comprehensive source code example, you can refer to my school attendance support website project here: [PBL04_DUT_student-checkin-system](https://github.com/tranductri2003/PBL04_DUT_student-checkin-system).

## Installation

We welcome you to install and try out our program.

After cloning my project from GitHub, you will need to set up both the BackEnd and FrontEnd to run the project.

### BackEnd Setup:

1. Refer to the `sample-backend-env.txt` file and modify it with your parameters, then place it into the `core` folder of the BackEnd.
2. Set up a virtual environment and install the required libraries as specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Start the BackEnd server using the command:
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver

### FrontEnd Setup:
